<li> <u>1.50e 19 November 2015</u>
<ul>
<li> On Macs, thanks to Curtis Rueden and Brandon Hurr, the <i>Stack to Images</i>,
<i>Window&gt;Tile</i> and <i>Window&gt;Cascade</i> commands, and non-batch mode
macros that process multiple images, run faster
(<a href="macros/SetMenuBarBenchmark.txt">test macro</a>).
<li> Pressing "i" (<i>Image&gt;Show Info</i>) when no images are open now
displays useful information.
<li> Thanks to Peter Haub, the <i>Selection Rotator</i> tool, available in
the toolbar's "&gt;&gt;" menu, now rotates about the selection centroid and is recordable.
<li> Thanks to Radoslaw Ejsmont, ImageJ's directory chooser, on Mac OS X, now uses the
JFileChooser when the "Use JFileChoose to open/save" option is enabled in
<i>Edit&gt;Options&gt;Input/Output</i>. Unlike the native directory chooser,
JFileChooser still has a title bar on OS X 10.11 (El Capitan).
<li> Thanks to Anton Jormescu and John Wolodzko, you can again change the views in
<i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Orthoganal Views</i> by clicking, but not
dragging, in the XZ and YZ planes.
<li> Added a "Show all" checkbox and a "Help" button to the multi-point
tool options dialog box.
<li> Thanks to John Wolodzko, added the Plot.showValues macro function,
which displays plot window values in the Results table.
<li> Thanks to Peter Haub, added the Roi.getCentroid() method.
<li> Thanks to Jan Eglinger, fixed a bug that caused <i>Image&gt;Adjust&gt;Size</i>, 
when using  bilinear or bicubic interpolation, to shift positions of pixels by 1.0 in X,
0.5 in Y and 0.5 in Z.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, fixed a bug that caused the
<i>Brightness/Contrast</i> adjuster's "Apply" function to not be
undoable for full images or rectangular selections with 8-bit and 16-bit images.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, fixed a bug that caused the
<i>Brightness/Contrast</i> adjuster to hang with RGB images
when there was a non-rectangular selection extending beyond image boundary.
<li> Thanks to Bob Hamilton, fixed bugs that caused the <i>Run to Insertion Point</i>
macro debugger command to fail and the debugger to sometimes behave erratically.
<li> Thanks to David Gault, fixed a potential memory leak by adding a close()
method to the CompositeImage class.
<li> Thanks to Jan Eglinger, fixed a bug with the "d" (<i>Draw</i>) keyboard shortcut 
that caused it to not be correctly recorded.
<li> Thanks to Anton Jormescu, fixed a bug in the
<i>Image&gt;Stack&gt;Tools&gt;Grouped Z Project</i> command
that changed the Z and T dimensions of the original stack, which caused
the <i>Duplicate</i> and <i>Synchronize Windows</i> commands to not
work as expected.
<li> Thanks to Carl Vandewater, fixed a bug that could cause
<i>Image&gt;Color&gt;Merge Channels</i> to throw an exception
when an input file name was shorter than three characters.
<li> Thanks to Till Bretschneider, fixed a bug on OS X and Java 8 that
caused copying of text from the macro recorder to fail.
<li> Thanks to Saibal Mitra, fixed a v1.50d regression that caused the
<i>Process&gt;Math&gt;Macro</i> command to not work correctly with 32-bit images.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, fixed a v1.49 regression that caused NaN values to
not be correctly handled in plots.
